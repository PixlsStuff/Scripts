This is a script to create a 'super resolution' image from a stack of lower resolution images.

USAGE: Place this script into a directory containing a series of .jpg images. Images should be taken hand-held with any image stabilizion off, and with a fast shutter speed to avoid motion blur. At least 9 or 10 images are needed, and probably no more than 20. Open a terminal in this director and execute the script. It will create a new subdirectory for the aligned images, and will produce two output "super resolution" images with detail at twice the resolution of the input images. One, SR_mean.jpb" uses the mean of the image stack to calculate the final pixel values (better luminosity values and potential increase in dynamic range. Chance of "ghosting"). The other, "SR_median.jpg" will use the median value (better sharpness, perhaps, and less chance of ghosting effects).
